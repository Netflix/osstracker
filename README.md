OSS Tracker
==========

OSS Tracker is an application that collects information about a Github organization and aggregates the data across
all projects within that organization into a single user interface to be used by various roles within the owning
organization.

For the community manager, all repositories are listed and metrics are combined for the organization as a whole.  A
community manager can also organize projects into functional areas and appoint shepherds of these areas to assign
management and engineering leads.

The shepherds of each functional area can not only assign and maintain leads for each project, but view
aggregated metrics for their area.

For individual owners, the OSS tracker gives a daily summary as well as historical information on key repository
metrics such as open issues and pull requests, days since last commit, and average time to resolve issues and pull
requests.

OSS Tracker works by running multiple analysis jobs as part of osstracer-scraper periodically.  These jobs populate
a project ownership database as well as a time series project statistics database.  OSS Tracker when exposes a web
application (osstracker-console) that gives visibility into these databases as well as access to control ownership
and categorization of each project.  In order to decrease the need for advanced visualization, much of the time series
data graphing leverages kibana on top of elasticsearch.
